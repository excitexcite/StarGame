# StarGame

StarGame - a university gamedevelopment project. The main project purpose is to get some communications skills during the development process.

The main game's purpose is very simple: you are a pilot of a starship that explore the galaxy. Exploration is not a safe business, so you must be ready to protect yourself. Destroy all the enemies to get as much points as possible, and don't forget about useful bonuses.
